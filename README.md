# esp8266Module
A bit of code for the ESP8226 Module running the 9.2.2 firmware at 9600bps

It is a pretty simple setup and will stream line the process of sending and recieving data. This example sends a value and recieves the current UK time and weather. You can change the weather location too to get it for your city/country.
